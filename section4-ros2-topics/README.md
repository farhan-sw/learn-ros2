# Intro
It is now the time to explore ROS communication features.
At the end of this section you will be able to make your nodes communicate between each other, using ROS2 Topics.

Here’s what you’ll do in this section:
- Understand what is a ROS2 topic thanks to a real life analogy
- Write your own Topic (publisher/subscriber) in both Python and Cpp
- Debug topics with ROS2 tools
- Experiment on Turtlesim
And finally, you’ll work on an activity to practice on everything you’ve seen until this point.

And now, what is a ROS2 Topic?
